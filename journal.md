### day one - july 20
I wanna make a cross gantry 3d printer cuz i saw a youtube video of one lol
im going to start with making the gantry rn

ok i did it now im kinda concerned about how small the build space but idrc tbh
this was quite simple its just a bunch of mgn12 linear rails and some belts i modelled cuz i like making belts and 4 pulleys and 4 idlers 

also i added a ender 2 pro bed cuz idk i already had it saved and its small so it works for this printer
